# UI Test Automation with Appium

UI Test Automation in NativeScript is possible with [nativescript-dev-appium plugin](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-appium). It wraps the popular [Appium open-source test automation framework](http://appium.io/) to provide an easy way to create and run E2E automation tests for NativeScript apps.

Using the plugin requires to have basic knowledge of Appium first, so make sure to check the [official documentation](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/). Then you are ready to start your NativeScript app E2E testing. For basic requirements, installation details and usage, please refer the [pluginâ€™s README](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-appium/blob/master/README.md).
