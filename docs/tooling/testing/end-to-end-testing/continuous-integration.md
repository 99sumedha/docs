# Continuous Integration

Once you have you have a set of tests, it's good to run them on a regular basis or when a new code is added to the code base. This is where the Continuous Integrations(CI) comes into play. There are different platforms that can be used for CI - some require local installation, others are public and free for open-source projects. To mention some of them:

- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
- [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/)


**TODO** Describe how to setup Travis & Saucelabs for example...
