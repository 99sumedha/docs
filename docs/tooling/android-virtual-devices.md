# Setup Android Emulators (AVD)

Follow the official documentation on [Creating and Managing Virtual Devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html), where the process of downloading, setting up, and using Android Emulators via Android studio is covered.

* Note: if your top-level "Tools" menu does not include the "Android" option (common issue in versions >3.0.0), follow the instructions in [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46948322/how-to-open-avd-manager-in-android-studio-3-0-version) to add this to the toolbar and enable the AVD Manager.
