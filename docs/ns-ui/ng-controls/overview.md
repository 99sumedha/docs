# Installation
The Angular directives for NativeScript UI are part of the plugins that provide each component and are available on npmjs.org. For each plugin you can find the directives in a `angular` folder within the plugin's main folder. From that point, you have a couple of approaches to use components which are described in the Getting started article.
