# Overview
The Item Selection feature allows the end users to select items. A couple of selection modes are available, as well as events which are fired when the selection state of an item changes.

There are two _selection behaviors_ which define how item selection works:
- `None` - items cannot be selected
- `Press` - items are selected by tapping on them
- `LongPress` - items are selected by holding them

There are two main selection modes:
- _multiple selection_ - allows for selecting multiple items. `RadListView` keeps track of which items are selected and exposes them through a `getSelectedItems()` method. Multiple selection is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `true`.
- _single selection_ - only one item can be selected at a time. This mode is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `false`.

# Selection events
To notify you when the selection state of an item is changed, `RadListView` exposes the following events:
- `itemSelecting` - fired before an item is selected. Can be used to cancel the operation
- `itemSelected` - fired after an item is successfully selected. At this point the item is already in the selected items array returned by the `getSelectedItems()` method
- `itemDeselecting` - fired before an item is deselected. Can be used to cancel the operation
- `itemDeselected` - fired after an item has been successfully deselected. At this point the item is not part of the selected items array returned by the `getSelectedItems()` method.
