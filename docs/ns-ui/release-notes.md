# Release notes: 2.0.0

## General

## Fixed
**RadChart**
- Setting `verticalAxis/horizontalAxis` of an Series object (Multiple axes) at runtime (angular) does not work while running on iOS
- In the `pointSelected/pointDeselected` events on iOS the `pointIndex` of the ChartEventData is undefined
- The `series` of the `ChartEventData` in the `pointSelected` event on Android is null
- When running on {N} + Angular 2 in Android the `Palette` is shared between the entire series families causing the default to be overridden

**RadDataForm**
-	fixed an issue with `index` property not being applied correctly

**RadListView**
- Setting styles to `headerItemTemplate` and `footerItemTemplate` via css (class) are not applied on Android


**RadSideDrawer**

- In {N} + Angular 2 application setting the `transition` property via binding initialized in `ngOnInit` causes incorrect offset

```
drawerMain -> tkMainContent
