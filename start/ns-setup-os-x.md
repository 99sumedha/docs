# Set Up the NativeScript CLI on OS X

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge and anonymously.

On OS X systems, you can use the NativeScript CLI to develop Android and iOS apps.

* [Environment Requirements](#environment-requirements)
* [Setup](#setup)

## System Requirements

* OS X Mavericks or later
* The latest Node.js 0.10.x, 0.12.x, 4.x, or 5.x stable official release
* (Optional) Homebrew to simplify the installation of dependencies
* For iOS development
    * Latest Xcode
    * Command-line tools for Xcode
* For Android development
    * JDK 8 or a later stable official release
    * Android SDK 22 or a later stable official release
    * Local Maven repository for Support Libraries
    * Android SDK Build-tools 23.0.0 or a later stable official release
    * (Optional) Genymotion to expand your testing options

### Quick Setup

If this is your first time developing a mobile project, consider using the one-liner scripts in this section to effortlessly setup your machine.
If you have experience developing mobile apps, you may skip to the [Environment Requirements](#environment-requirements) section below.

Using Spotlight, search `Terminal` and start it. This opens a console window. Copy and paste this script:

> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/production/setup/native-script.rb)"

The script calls some of the commands using `sudo` and you may need to provide your password several times. Note that the script downloads and installs some big dependencies and may take some time to complete.

## Environment Requirements

For Android development

* JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set
* ANDROID_HOME environment variable must be set

## Setup

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to simplify the installation process.
