# Welcome to NativeScript

NativeScript is how you build cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps without web views. Use Angular, TypeScript or modern JavaScript to get truly native UI and performance while sharing skills and code with the web. Get 100% access to native APIs via JavaScript and reuse of packages from npm, CocoaPods and Gradle. Open source and backed by Telerik.

#Angular for NativeScript

NativeScript doesn’t require Angular, but it’s even better when you use it. 

You can fully reuse skills and code from the web to build beautiful, high performance native mobile apps without web views. NativeScript features deep integration with Angular 2, the latest and greatest (and fastest) Angular framework.

Open source and backed by Telerik.
