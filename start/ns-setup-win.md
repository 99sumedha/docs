# Set Up the NativeScript CLI on Windows

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge and anonymously.

On Windows systems, you can use the NativeScript CLI to develop only Android apps. This limitation is caused by the requirements for iOS development.

* [System Requirements](#system-requirements)
* [Environment Requirements](#environment-requirements)
* [Setup](#setup)

## System Requirements

* Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later
* The latest Node.js 0.10.x, 0.12.x, 4.x, or 5.x stable official release
* (Optional) Chocolatey to simplify the installation of dependencies
* JDK 8 or a later stable official release
* Android SDK 22 or a later stable official release
* Android Support Repository
* Android SDK Build-tools 22.0.0 or a later stable official release
* (Optional) Genymotion to expand your testing options

### Quick setup

If this is your first time developing a mobile project, consider using the one-liner scripts in this section to effortlessly setup your machine. 
If you have experience developing mobile apps, you may skip to the [Environment Requirements](#environment-requirements) section below.

Open Start Menu, search for `Command Prompt` and start it. This opens a console window. Copy and paste this script:

> @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/production/setup/native-script.ps1'))"

You may need to accept an User Account Control prompt to grant the script administrative privileges. Note that the script downloads and installs some big dependencies and may take some time to complete. 

## Environment Requirements

For Android development

* JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set
* ANDROID_HOME environment variable must be set
