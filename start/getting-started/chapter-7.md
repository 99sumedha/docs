## Next steps

Sadly our tutorial is now complete, but your journey with NativeScript is just beginning. Let’s look at the next steps you’ll need to take to build your next app with NativeScript.

### Join the NativeScript community

- Follow [@nativescript](https://twitter.com/nativescript) on Twitter for the latest and greatest news about NativeScript.
- Join the [NativeScript Community Slack channel](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). The channel is a great place to ask questions, and chat with others in the NativeScript community.

### Starting your own app

Although you’re welcome to use Groceries as the basis of own app, if you do want to start your own app from scratch, the NativeScript CLI provides a number of built-in starting points. For example, you can start a new “hello world” app by running the `tns create` command:

```
tns create MyNextGreatApp
```

If you want to start from a slightly more complete starting point, the `tns create` command also has a `--template` option that lets you start from a variety of pre-built templates. For instance, the following command creates a NativeScript project with tab navigation already setup.

```
tns create MyNextGreatApp --template tns-template-tab-navigation
```

> **TIP**: A number of other templates are available to use with the `--template` option, including TypeScript templates and more. Refer to [the full list of official templates](https://www.tjvantoll.com/2016/02/22/creating-nativescript-templates/) at any time.

Regardless of which template you choose to start from, once you have your app up and running, let’s look at some of the resources you can use as you develop your next app.

### NativeScript learning resources

There is a variety of learning material that goes above and beyond what was offered in this tutorial.

* NativeScript provides a series of [real-world app samples](https://www.nativescript.org/app-samples-with-code) that are all open source on GitHub. These samples are great to reference as you’re developing your application.
    * The NativeScript kitchen sink demo app shows off what NativeScript is capable of, and therefore is a great reference when you’re trying to implement a particular UI. You can refer to [its code on GitHub](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-marketplace-demo), or [download the app from the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/examples-nativescript/id1046772499?ls=1&mt=8), or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.nativescriptmarketplacedemo&amp;hl=en), to see the app in action.
