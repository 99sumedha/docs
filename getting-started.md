# Getting Started

NativeScript strips the complexity from native development both in terms of required coding skills and system setup. 

To get started, you need JavaScript or TypeScript knowledge to implement your business logic, XML and CSS knowledge to design your UI and an idea for a mobile app. You do not need Java or Objective-C knowledge.

Once you have your app idea, you can get started in a few minutes.

You can find more details about each step of the setup and project creation process below and at the referenced pages of the documentation.

### 1. Choose your tools and **[set up your system](setup/quick-setup.md)**.

If you are familiar with the Cordova CLI or if you want to develop and build your apps locally and free of charge, you can set up your system with the **NativeScript CLI**.
	
* [Windows setup](setup/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-win.md)
* [OS X setup](setup/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-os-x.md)
* [Linux setup](setup/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-linux.md)

If you prefer to concentrate on development and build your apps with a third-party build service, you can use the [Telerik AppBuilder tools](setup/ab-setup/ab-web-setup.md).
	
* [In-browser IDE](setup/ab-setup/ab-web-setup.md)
* [Windows IDE](setup/ab-setup/ab-win-setup.md)
* [Extension for Visual Studio](setup/ab-setup/ab-vse-setup.md)
* [CLI](setup/ab-setup/ab-cli-setup.md)

### 2. Go through the **Hello World** tutorial for your preferred tool set.

This quick start development guide will introduce you to the basic architecture of a NativeScript app, data binding and how to implement user interfaces and styling.

* [Hello World from the NativeScript CLI](hello-world/hello-world-ns-cli.md)
* [Hello World from AppBuilder](hello-world/hello-world-appbuilder.md)

### 3. Learn from the full app samples prepared by the NativeScript team.

[Sample apps with open source code](samples.md)

### 4. Explore the **[modules overview](modules.md)** and the **[API Reference](ApiReference/application/README.md)**.

The extensive overview and API reference will introduce to the how-tos of NativeScript development. You will learn how to tap into the native capabilities that you want to implement inside your app.
