# Upgrade Instructions

To upgrade a NativeScript application you need to upgrade several things: NativeScript CLI Tooling, the iOS and Android runtimes and the cross-platform modules. In the steps below you will see how to do this. Please also keep in mind that you should read the [breaking changes] (./breaking-changes) for each release.

### Upgrading the NativeScript Tools

First thing to do is upgrade your `tns` (or `nativescript`) command, so go to a command prompt or bash/terminal prompt and type:
```
npm update -g nativescript
```

This will update you to the latest version of the nativescript command line.  
You can type `tns --version` to verify new version is installed.

### Upgrading the Platforms

Next thing you will need to upgrade is your **platforms** in order to get the latest enhancements of the Android and/or iOS runtimes. So navigate to the root level folder where your project is; and then if you are working on a Android project type:
```
tns platform update android
```

and/or (if you are working on a iOS version on a Macintosh):
```
tns platform update ios
```

### Upgrading TNS Modules

Ð¢he next piece is a bit more tricky as it requires more steps. The easiest method is to create a new project and then copy the **tns_modules** out of the new project into your existing project and then delete the dummy project.

So at a command line do the following (assuming you are still in your main app project folder from the steps above). Please remember to replace **<yourapp>** with whatever folder name your app is in.

Windows:
```
cd ..
tns create TempApp
rd /S /Q <yourapp>\app\tns_modules
move TempApp\app\tns_modules <yourapp>\app
rd /S /Q TempApp
```

Linux/Macintosh:
```
cd ..
tns create TempApp
rm -rf <yourapp>/app/tns_modules
mv TempApp/app/tns_modules <yourapp>/app
rm -rf TempApp
```

Another way to achieve this is to go to [NativeScript Releases](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/releases/), download tns-core-\*.tgz containing the cross-platform modules from the respective release, unpack them and replace the content of the **tns_modules** folder in your project with them.
