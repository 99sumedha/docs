# Chart Axes: LinearAxis

{% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} requires an axis that can represent the values of the data points. The {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} plots the associated data points using each point's actual value, provided for the axis. The axis works with categorical data and uses the Value property of each CategoricalDataPoint that needs to be plotted. It will build a numerical range (user-defined or automatically calculated) and will determine each data point X or Y coordinate (depending on whether the axis is specified as Horizontal or as Vertical).

```
<LinearAxis v-tkCartesianVerticalAxis></LinearAxis>
```

### Features

#### Major Step

The major step represents the value difference between two visible ticks on the axis. The major step unit is used to determine what exactly the value of the major step represents. To get or set the major step use the **majorStep** property.

#### Maximum

Defines the maximum available value. To get or set the maximum use the {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis,member:maximum%} property.

#### Minimum

Defines the minimum available value. To get or set the maximum use the {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis,member:minimum%}  property.

#### Plot Mode

The {% typedoc_link classes:DateTimeCategoricalAxis %} allows you to define how exactly the axis will be plotted on the viewport of the chart. The possible values are:

* {% typedoc_link modules:AxisPlotMode,member:BetweenTicks%}: Points are plotted in the middle of the range, defined between each two ticks.
* {% typedoc_link modules:AxisPlotMode,member:OnTicks%}: Points are plotted over each tick.
* {% typedoc_link modules:AxisPlotMode,member:OnTicksPadded%}: Points are plotted over each tick with half a step padding applied on both ends of the axis.

You can get and set the current value with the **plotMode** property.
