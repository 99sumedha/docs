# NativeScript with Vue.js
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) is a lightweight, ‘progressive framework’ that is designed for building user interfaces. NativeScript integrates with Vue.js, just like it does with Angular, to offer a standard way for building cross platform native mobile apps. If you have used Vue.js before you will feel right at home with NativeScript-Vue.

# Get Started
NativeScript-Vue integration is entirely community driven project and its documentation is hosted on https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/introduction/.
