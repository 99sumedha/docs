# NativeScript with Vue.js
<a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> is a lightweight, ‘progressive framework’ that is designed for building user interfaces. NativeScript integrates with Vue.js, just like it does with Angular, to offer a standard way for building cross platform native mobile apps. If you have used Vue.js before you will feel right at home with NativeScript-Vue.

## Get Started
NativeScript-Vue integration is entirely community driven project and its documentation is hosted on <a href="https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/introduction/" target="_blank">nativescript-vue plugin site</a>.
